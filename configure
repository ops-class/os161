# Configure script for OS/161 tree.

# Must be run with the top of the OS/161 tree as its current directory.
#
# Note: while this superficially acts like a GNU Autoconf configure
# script, it was not generated by autoconf. Scripts generated by
# autoconf are much harder to read. :-)

# If this script bombs out, you can create defs.mk by hand based on
# the comments in mk/os161.config.mk.

# is a make variable, not a shell variable. This means it gets expanded
# when make runs rather than when this script runs.
