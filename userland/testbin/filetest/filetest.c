 * filetest.c
 *
 * 	Tests the filesystem by opening, writing to and reading from a
 * 	user specified file.
 *
 * This should run (on SFS) even before the file system assignment is started.
 * It should also continue to work once said assignment is complete.
 * It will not run fully on emufs, because emufs does not support remove().
